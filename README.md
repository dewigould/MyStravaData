# MyStravaData
In this repo I do some basic expoloratory data analysis (EDA) and visualiation of my Strava activities (obtained using Strava API).

There are three notebooks
- EDA.ipynb
- Kudos_NN.ipynb
- Kudos_RandomForest.ipynb

For a bit of fun, I construct a simple neural network model in the second notebook, and random forest model in the third, to try to predict what activies will get $>5$ or $<=5$ kudos (likes). There are a variety of features, both numerical (e.g. distance, time, speed) and categorical (type of activity, location etc.) In these notebooks I get to grips with various basic feature engineering steps and play around with training some simple models.
